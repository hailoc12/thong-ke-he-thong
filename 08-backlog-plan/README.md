# Backlog & Plan

Organized work items by status using Kanban workflow.

## Folder Structure
- `todo/` - Tasks waiting to be started
- `doing/` - Tasks currently in progress (limit: 1-3)
- `done/` - Completed tasks

## Workflow
1. Create new tasks in `todo/`
2. When starting: **Move file** to `doing/`
3. When complete: **Move file** to `done/`

**Important**: Physically move files between folders - don't just update status text.
